					<p>Tree care is essential for both safety and aesthetic reasons, as trees are an important part of the overall property and can have a impact on both home value and the general well-being of the residents.

					There are a number of reasons why  a professional tree service is required. For safety purposes, large trees need to be trimmed, as dead overhanging branches can pose a threat to homes and people. Similarly, trimming and pruning is essential for overall appeal and the growth of other plant life. If you would like to have a professional tree service company in Clearwater look at your trees, we would be happy to assist you. There is no cost to do so. – The Tree Feller</p>

		<h2 center>About Us</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Mitch Feller, also known as “The Tree Feller”. I am a Pinellas county resident and father to 2 wonderful girls and husband to my beautiful wife. Before my life as “The Tree Feller”, I served as a fire fighter with the Pinellas County fire department. It was a honor to be able to serve my community. In that time, I have seen the devastation Florida’s tropical storms and hurricanes can cause. I helped with the cleanup in the aftermath of some of the worst storms. In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew devastated Southern Florida, I took my first steps towards a career in the tree service industry. I am a certified arborist and can tell you almost anything about your trees. I like to think of myself as “the Lorax”</p><br>
		
		<h4 center>Our Passion</h4>
		<p>Because tree care and serving our community is our passion, we feel it’s important to involve you in the process of your tree maintenance or removal. We want to match your expectations with the needs of your tree. It is our pleasure to inform you of all your options and to communicate with you to address any concerns. Our goal is your satisfaction in our work.</p>
